# sequential-tools
Placeholder for some quick [Sequential](https://sequential.com/) synth tools.

These may eventually move elsewhere or get replaced by better tools.
They're often quick scripts, sometimes without much error checking.

They should work on macOS (and perhaps other Unix systems with the requisite tools used within).

## Tools.

* **pro3-wavetable-renumber.sh:** Shell script ([Bash](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashtop.html)) to renumber the slot a [Sequential Pro 3](https://www.sequential.com/product/pro-3/)/[Pro 3 SE](https://www.sequential.com/product/pro-3-se/) user [wavetable SysEx file](https://www.sequential.com/2020/07/user-wavetables-for-pro-3/) should load into.
* **[px-preset-sample-renumber](https://synthmanage.com):** Renumbers the sample group references in Sequential [Prophet X](https://www.sequential.com/product/prophet-x/)/[XL](https://www.sequential.com/product/prophet-xl/) patches. This program is not in this repository; it lives on [synthmanage.com](https://synthmanage.com). Other tools may eventually move there.

## To Do
Add more documentation.
